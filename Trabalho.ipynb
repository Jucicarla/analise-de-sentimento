If we go to a normal restaurant we have dozens of options for drinks, starters, main courses and desserts ... If I had more options I would never have ordered the lasagna because I am not a fan of pasta (although it was very good) but the other option was a mix of corn cream, lentils, chickpeas and etc and I didn't want to take any chances ... In the end, I would like to have several options mainly of desserts. I know it's a lot of work, but that would ensure that the same people could come back many times.

The service is impeccable - highlighting the waiter Ramon - and the food is delicious. I think I expected more for the repercussion of the establishment, which despite having a very tasty pasta, is not something that is not found out there. In SP there are even houses with pasta that are as good or even better for more affordable prices. Worth the visit for the charm of the place and to draw your own conclusions.'},\n",
