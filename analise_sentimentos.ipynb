            "3 I have had ice cream at Visabor for over 30 years. Fruit or artificial flavors. Crunchy cone and simple atmosphere. Very good prices. I recommend\n",
            "4 The best hamburger I've ever eaten! Excellent service, the food was great. The restaurant is quite small, but nice and fun.\n",
            "5 The restaurant is new, super cozy and charming with great service. The portions are generous, very tasty and at a fair price. Good selection of wines. I highly recommend the seafood spaghetti, bolognese, carbonara and risotto. The tiramisu is also fantastic.\n",
            "Every time I went with my boyfriend, but it is an excellent environment to take family or friends.\n",
            "7 Great food with good attendance and with a lot of good things to take your wife and girlfriend and family because the food portions are good!\n",

            "10 I was with my family this afternoon for the first time I came across a beautiful and cozy setting. I bought 1 kg of BIG shrimp, I looked at the boy weighing and choosing my shrimp. The disappointment came when I sat at the stall and asked to fry it (I don't want to mention the name) The shrimp arrived very tasty but the big prawns (it came on top) When we went to eat the inside there were only tiny shriveled shrimp (old ones) ) As if they exchanged a good part. So far so good, when the shrimp ended I realized that it had about 20 heads without the body as if it were leftovers ... I called the waiter in disguise and he just made sure he did not listen and went to another table. I really felt like a muggle. Anyway, I ask you to pay attention, the place is great. I loved it, I will be back, but to eat a fish, because shrimp I only buy to take and fry at my house.\n",
            "11 I went to La Bocca after reading so many complimentary and excited comments. First of all, I want to say that I don't understand why some criticize the location so much. It is a quiet, residential street, whose houses are very reminiscent of Rio's suburbs. A grace! Now I will talk about the food. I ordered the highly praised plantain gnocchi with ossobuco ragout. The first mouthful is delicious, but, little by little, it becomes nauseating given the absence of nuances, textures and layers of flavors. The ossobuco sauce sins the excess salt. Overall, a correct dish, but nothing splendid. I emphasize, however, that it is an oasis to eat pasta made at home in this Rio de Janeiro populated with frozen third-party pasta disguised as gnocchi.\n",
            "12 Excellent restaurant!\n",
            "The diversity of the self served very high taste and unmatched flavors!\n",

            "16 The DR LASER Family was on Saturday for an informal lunch ... A well prepared Grill and a very varied Buffet with an ok price, make the place a good option for a quick weekend lunch.\n",
            "17 Indescribable, I had never eaten tapioca and decided to try it in Natal-RN, I ate in some places, but by far this was the best. The only place in our stay that we made a point of repeating, even though we knew we could lose another attraction, but it was worth the risk of losing a new attraction, because this place is just wonderful. Go prepared, because the portion is well served and the dessert is huge! We tried some, but the best was Carne de Sol with Cream! ! !\n",
            "18 He had seen the criticism and really expected more. The service was great and everything was fresh, but it wasn't the best ceviche I've ever had. Well gourmet. The very small portion.\n",
            "19 This restaurant is located on Avenida Conde, easily accessible to those in the center and the surrounding area. It mixes contemporary dishes with a tendency to those of the Iberian peninsula. Try the starters, for example the ragout. An excellent choice is also the Mediterranean. Attentive waiters and a welcoming atmosphere leave us with a taste for more. Worth the visit.\n",
            "20 Located a little far from the center, it is a quiet place with great structure (very good and comfortable tables and chairs).\n",
            "The menu is a little weak due to the size of the restaurant .. there is not much variety of portions.\n",
            "It's great because it doesn't get too crowded, and the sea ahead is very calm.\n",
            "Average service.\n",
            "21 I had lunch with friends at this place and I really have to comment, delicious food, draft beer, excellent service, nothing to complain about, a place for families, couples and a group of friends.\n",
            "22 The place is very beautiful and has beers from other countries, but the prices are very salty and the service was not the best.\n",
            "23 The bar was packed, so far without problems, after all it was December 30th.\n",
            "The biggest issue was, the very rude promoter, a total disorganization regarding the clearance of the tables and the air conditioning was far from working, the doors open without the wind curtain equipment, it only made it worse.\n",
            "Trying to order drinks at the bar didn't help either, the waiters are all located in one place at the counter, you need to be waving the command or being squeezed at the end where they are serving.\n",
            "The minimum we expect from a beachfront bar is to work very well in the summer.\n",
            "The evaluation is very compromised, I couldn't drink or eat anything.\n",
            "24 Loopfood is one of the best sandwiches in Curitiba. Light, tasty and well seasoned, there's no mistake when you're hungry. The request is to eat together with a juice, there is no way to say no.\n",
            "25 Good service fair price very good food very pleasant the place at night has a beautiful people super recommend\n",
            "26 Tereza's house is for me the best in Salvador! Starting with the location, in the most bohemian neighborhood of Salvador, in an old house, with rustic decor, accompanied by the sound of a grand piano, which harmonizes so well with the exquisite menu.\n",
            "It goes beyond a gastronomic experience. \"See, hear, feel\" ...\n",
            "Bahian cuisine under a sensitive and daring touch makes this restaurant exceptional.\n",
            "27 The restaurant's presentation is an attraction in itself, all decorated with Northeastern themes! The tapiocas are delicious, huge, also offers couscous, salads, juices and smoothies. Very good!\n",
            "28 The worst thing that can happen in a restaurant is that you are cheated. I chose the filet mignon dish with the wood sauce and when the dish arrived there was only a small slice of very hard meat, which, as I understand it, was a hard leg. It shouldn't have been even 50 grams, it was a small, thin slice. The restaurant's unfortunate attitude was once good.\n",
            "29 Single price vegetarian restaurant with the right to repeat food and juices, but I felt full right away on the first dish and juice. Do you accept credit card. There is a lack of dishes with lighter seasoning, more colorful presentation and less nauseating aroma. Going without meat is not easy, if vegetarian dishes are not tasty it is difficult to return.\n",
            "30 Place with typical and specialized food in carne de sol, which comes with string beans, manioc, pirão de leite, .... A plate for two and left over, in our case. Fair price and excellent service. goat.\n",
            "31 I had lunch in January this year! Main dish is Carne do Sol à Potiguar, this meat is very tender and accompanies: Cooked Macaxeira, Paçoca, Butter\n",

            "35 The location of the restaurant is already worth it ... It is inside the Mangal das Garças - place we love !! We were very well attended but we found it expensive for what it provides .... It presents typical dishes with peculiar flavors in the self-service scheme with fixed price !!!\n",
            "36 The place is delicious for a beer on a sunny day mostly. The food is good as is the service. But prepare the pocket, as it is easy for the account to exceed 100 reais per person.\n",
            "37 A perfect restaurant for those looking for regional food. A very kind place on earth. Good for you to go with family friends. Very delicious food.\n",
            "38 Nice and relatively stripped down. Attentive but not excellent service. Reasonable drink menu, some good beer brands are missing. Pizza well done, but not delicious. In summary, the location is good but not great. Rio de Janeiro is in need.\n",
            "39 A restaurant with unique flavors and varieties. Excellent dishes and very good service.\n",
            "40 Wonderful hamburger with first class ingredients\n",
            "Excelent reception\n",
            "And clean and cozy environment.\n",
            "41 The health of Nilo Peçanha was better and cleaner. I ordered a natural chicken sandwich and came a pile of leaves with shredded chicken and an indecipherable yellow sauce, tasteless and falling apart. I don't think they ever cleaned windows or made maintenance on the deck, left. Feather.\n",
            "42 Quick and affordable snacks, a good choice for the weekend with friends or children. Good menu and service\n",
            "43 Very nice place, excellent food, impeccable service ... the place really surprised me ... congratulations\n",
            "44 Very good food at a fair price. Don't forget to eat the coxinha.\n",
            "Come prepared for a short queue, no more than half an hour\n",
            "45 Very good service. Standard service. Food very well served. Optimal quality. Pleasant environment. Sound at low volume.\n",
            "46 Cantina di Napoli is an excellent option for Italian cuisine in Fortaleza, with great service, good wine list and a typical Italian menu, as well as contemporary cuisine. Don't forget to try the seafood spaghetti ...\n",
            "47 Pleasant atmosphere, with good music and service note 10. Congratulations to waitress Iraci, very attentive!\n",
            "48 Spaces and with 3 different environments, the drinks are great, the options of appetizers and food on the menu are factual and please everyone and the prices are fair.\n",
            "Sometimes the service leaves a little to be desired, but for that it is not very demanding you may not even notice the delay.\n",
            "49 The lounge is large and the tables accommodate groups. At the entrance is a shelf with wines that you can choose and order at the table. The starters are excellent, but small. The pasta with bourgnion sauce is delicious!\n",
            "50 I love McDonald´s sandwiches, especially the Big Mac and today I tried the Super Big Mac at Shopping Recife, made with three hamburgers and it was even more delicious, super delicious ... I loved it! I also like ice cream a lot! In short ... I'm a fan! LOL\n",
            "51 Spread throughout the capital of Paraná, Restaurante Madero is a hamburger specializing in hamburgers and steaks.\n",
            "52 Self-service, located close to large companies. The value of kg is very cheap and the meat is good.\n",
            "53 Beautiful and super cozy place! Excellent music. Great service, super attentive waiters! Antipasti table with lots of options! Price justifies the quality!\n",
            "55 The facilities of the place already draw attention: with Italian characteristics, beautiful! The menu has many options of salads, starters, breads made by itself, all very fresh! .. the coffees are excellent, served not in cups, but in ceramic bowls, I loved it! for those who like to try new things - walnuts, cheese, honey accompaniments - and a purposefully rustic atmosphere and a good choice. Despite the slightly spiced price, it is worth the visit !.\n",
            "56 Good food, good atmosphere, compared to Camarões Natal RN, it leaves something to be desired, starting with the service.\n",
            "58 Excellent restaurant.\n",
            "There were two units when I went to Maceió: one close to the Craft Fair and another close to the Mercure Hotel. We went with a couple of friends together. They are different environments (the menu is the same): next to the Fair they have a more relaxed and young atmosphere with live music. Near the Mercure the lounge is closed and an environment with more families. I recommend the Shrimp Gum! You will not regret!!!\n",
            "60 I go to Felipe a lot, for me the Portuguese food is the best in the world. I start with cod or octopus with white wine and finish with lamb and red wine. Dessert, always, french toast!\n",
            "61 Eric, is a waiter at Coco Bambu Sul. Excellent service, attentive, friendly and seeks to expedite all orders quickly.\n",
            "62 I was with my family at Coco Bambu near Beira Mar in Fortaleza and ordered a dish that always like in São Paulo and without exception always comes out wonderful. But on this visit the Beira Mar branch was very disappointed with the dish. First the amount of Cameroon was extremely reduced, and with that what came was potato straw and rice that was dry. I complained to the waiter who agreed with the criticism, and told me that the Maitre d 'would come to the table, which I am waiting for so far. Summary, lousy dish and no attitude from the house staff. Unfortunate. The bill was over R $ 270.00.\n",
            "63 Perhaps the best meat (or at least cost benefit) in Porto Alegre is served here. It is not a traditional gaucho barbecue, but a Uruguayan grilled parrilla. The simple atmosphere, with attentive and well-prepared waiters, invites you to Uruguayan cuts of excellent quality. Don't forget to order the provolone cheese, a must!\n",
            "64 I expected more from the service and especially the food ... nothing stupendous ... normal, satisfactory and average.\n",
            "65 I spent Friday night with my family at the restaurant, and decided to opt for a menu option other than the buffet since I wasn't going to eat much. My boyfriend went to the buffet and brought rice, but said he didn't want to eat until the end. So I tried only the rice from his buffet - a common practice when we go as a couple and want to try each other's food. Well, in the end the bill came as a portion of extra rice (as if I had \"taken advantage of the situation to eat rice\") and as if it had been two portions, with a value above that indicated on the menu. My disappointment was extreme, due to the lack of education and preparation of care.\n",
            "66 The place is simple, but the food is good and reasonably priced. It is possible to order and take it home.\n",
            "67 I found out I was one of the best, so I wanted to take the test! Great! I ordered cod and Pastel de Belém which left nothing to be desired than what I ate in Portugal! Added to a good wine and good chat! I recommend!\n",
            "68 The best late afternoon snack in Porto Velho. Regional and Pará food, with the best crab soup.\n",
            "Tip: the tempting cake is perfect\n",

            "70 The place is located in a beautiful Vilela in Petrópolis, and has outdoor and indoor tables. I went at night, the service was good and fast. I ordered a divine shrimp crepe (R $ 22) and my husband ordered a filet mignon (R $ 35). The only thing left to be desired was the rice, completely unsalted. The rest, I loved it!\n",
            "71 The atmosphere is very pleasant, the menu very good, with some very typical dishes. The decor is very beautiful, with the pictures on the landscape wall and the bar with the horizontal mirror on top. However, it is not physically like an Italian restaurant. Typical Italian restaurants have traditional set (or semi-set) tables with traditional chairs and do not have the configuration of tables with American cafeteria stalls and not even drinks like iced teas ... I worked 10 years ago in an Italian Restaurant in Italy , so I understand that this part was a commercial addition to the restaurant that doesn't exist in Italy. But overall, it is a very pleasant experience.\n",

Let's start with the letter of 'specials', as the Teresinense calls the artisanal ones and a couple of imported ones, like Stella Artois etc. A place that could have a beer sommelier, in addition to real beer taps, like wheat, Ale, IPA, among other options that in any store that has the name BEER in the name we can find. The guys who serve us don't know the glasses for each style; we are not offered something to harmonize with the particular style that was requested ...\n",

            "79 I have been there at the lunchtime buffet and at night a la carte dinner. In my opinion it is the best dinner in Belém, it was the best cub with chestnut crust that I eat in the city and serves Amazon beer.\n",
            "81 Nothing so interesting except the tapioca and crepes made to order that are a marvel. But the rest of the breakfast buffet is average and so is the service; I hope they improve in that aspect.\n",

            "87 This is the best Christmas steakhouse, with a varied meat and fish menu, personalized service. For those who like Japanese food you will enjoy it because the sushi is magnificent. But for my family the noble steak was wonderful and the roasted lamb was also divine. It also has a selection of incredible desserts. I recommend.\n",
            "88 Excellent pizza, thin crust, made in the wood oven. Wonderful place for those who want to see and be seen ... well frequented, always have a waiting line. Best to make a reservation ... It has a unique wine cellar that is worth exploring.\n",

Fresh juices made fresh, delicious snacks and a grocery store of natural products and breads made at home with lots of variety and fair prices.

I had eaten a few pizzas around the clock (+ - 11 pm) until the waiter came to ask me if there was any particular flavor that was waiting ..... after eating the flavors that I brought, I did the same with the sweets ... I ended up eating little variety .... I found it very disrespectful to the customer even for the amount paid which is not at all cheap.\n",

The meat was very good, although the sauce that accompanied it was a little too strong for my taste (maybe it could be optional or have other options). Even though the \"footprint\" of the place is simple, I would like to suggest that the cutlery should be changed when the main dish arrives, since they had already been used in the salad plate.

We sat down and ordered the menu 3 times. After about 20 minutes we received the same and while choosing the dishes I checked the information that they do not accept cards, only checks or cash. An absurdity in the middle of Ipanema and the XXI century. I don't think it's a good idea to have at least R $ 500.00 in the bag, at night in Rio de Janeiro to pay for dinner. We got up and decided to leave for another restaurant. The valet returned the car, all dirty with cement, as they parked it at the Metro construction site. We left for Restaurante D'Amici in Leme, where we were well served, where the grouper ravioli with prawns and saffron sauce was divine.\n",

            "186 We went to the restaurant with the suggestion of a friend. We were at Savassi and we got there quickly. The big surprise was the sauces that accompanied the two dishes we ordered. Very tasty! A portion of surubim with such an \"auntie sauce\" was very tasty! We also ordered a trio consisting of tilapia torresminho, linguicinha and manioc cake. This trio accompanied a lemon sauce and another that looked like barbecue. Anyway, all very good! And, to top it off, chilled beers! And the price is very easy. I highly recommend it.\n",

            "194 The bar is on the edge of the beach, has ambient sound, live music, good snacks and cold dishes and beers. The positive point of this Bar is the values ​​of the dishes and beers, compared to Rio de Janeiro. I recommend\n",
            "195 I looked for the tip here on tripadvisor and it was perfect! I tried a reservation at 20:00 but it didn't happen. We went straight and arrived at 20:30, with a queue for 2 people of 30 min. It was worth every minute of the wait! Location, service, food ... everything perfect. I highly recommend it!\n",
